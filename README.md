# DeafDogCommands

Deaf Dog Commands is a project designed to help owners communicate with their hearing-impaired dogs by issuing commands when the dog is not in the direct line of sight. While most deaf dog owners use sign language to communicate, the challenge arises when the dog is not looking at the owner or is out of sight. This project offers a solution by enabling owners to send commands to their dogs, even when the dog cannot see them.

The project consists of two key components:

1. iOS Application Code: An app that allows the user to interface with a Raspberry Pi, enabling communication with the dog through commands.
2. MicroPython Code: Code that runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico W, controlling the hardware to receive and process the commands from the iOS app.
